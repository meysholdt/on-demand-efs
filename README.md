# on-demand-efs

This example starts a postgres database via docker compose on an EFS volume. 
The EFS volume is named after the user's email address. If no EFS volume exists, this example will create a new EFS volume. 

### Setup

To make this example work for your AWS org, change all settings that have a "CHANGE-ME" comment.
